# EEG-Analysis
The project focuses on the analysis of EEG data using the Bonn EEG Dataset, a crucial resource 
in the field of neuroscience and medical diagnostics. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non
invasive method that records the electrical activity of the brain. This technique is vital in 
studying brain functions and diagnosing conditions like epilepsy. The Bonn EEG Dataset 
specifically includes recordings related to epileptic seizures, offering a unique opportunity to 
explore and classify different patterns of brain activity associated with epilepsy. By applying 
advanced classification models to this dataset, the project aims to enhance the understanding 
and detection of epileptic seizures, which is crucial for improving patient care and treatment 
strategies. This research leverages the high-resolution temporal data provided by EEG 
recordings to identify distinctive patterns that differentiate between normal and abnormal 
brain activity, a step forward in the field of biomedical engineering and neuroscience.
